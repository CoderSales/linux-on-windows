## open terminal

cmd > As admin

## list windows subsystem for linux distributions installed

### This list gives Linux Distro's Installed

``` bash
wsl --list --verbose
```

``` bash
wsl
```

``` bash
rmdir /s /q \\wsl$\DistroNameFromListAbove
```

After this if distro was previously installed,
use shortcut to launch distro,
and it may install automatically.

(Alternatively, may have to install Distro on Windows.)
